## <a id="1-6-0"></a> v1.6.0

**Release Date: July 12, 2022**

### New Features

- Support for using AWS IAM for authentication with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters.
This mitigates issues with needing to recreate credentials when using ECR.

### Breaking Changes

- Installing in air-gapped environments requires an additional configuration
value: `exclude_dependencies: true`.
- Previously, [Secret Syncing](synced-secrets.html) was enabled by default and has now been switched to disabled by default.
	- This may cause some builds that were previously able to pull ClusterBuilder images to give an authentication error after upgrade.
	- This was done to ensure secrets were not exported unintentionally.
	- To enable synced secrets use `enable_synced_secrets: true` in `tbs-values.yaml`
